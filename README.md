# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Bitcoin-Price-fluctuations

This is my capstone-project and is based on the issued paper - "Algorithmic Trading of Cryptocurrency Based on Twitter Sentiment Analysis" by Stuart Colianni, Stephanie Rosales, and Michael Signorotti (http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/029_report.pdf) and also added Time-Series analysis on the Bitcoin data.

I have used Twitter API "tweepy" to extract relevant tweets and applied sentiment analysis by categorizing the tweets as "positive", "negative" and "neutral"; to understand if a coorelation exists between the Bitcoin price change and Sentiment value change as an effect through applying various modelling techniques.
